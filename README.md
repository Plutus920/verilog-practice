# Verilog Basics: Digital Logic Building Blocks

This repository contains a collection of fundamental digital logic modules written in Verilog. It's intended for learning and demonstrating core concepts in hardware description and simulation.

--- Modules Included ---

** Combinational Logic **
    - full adder (adder.v)
    - 4x1 multiplexer (mux.v)
    - 8x3 priority encoder 


** Sequential Logic **
    - D flip flop 
    - jk flip flop
